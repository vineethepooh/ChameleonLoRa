# ChameleonLoRa
A dynamic Arduino LoRa wrapper that implements signal-aware frequency adaptation. By monitoring real-time RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), this library allows LoRa nodes to automatically 'hop' to clearer frequencies when interference is detected or signal quality degrades, ensuring a stable communication link.
